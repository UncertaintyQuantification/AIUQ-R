# Examples of AIUQ: Ab initio Uncertainty Quantification in R

This site gives examples of AIUQ R package in R available on CRAN:

AIQU is a set of uncertainty quantification and inverse estimation tools with the use of a probabilistic generative model from the beginning of the data analysis. An example is a Fourier basis method for inverse estimation in scattering analysis of microscopy videos. It does not require specifying a certain range of Fourier bases and it substantially reduces computational cost via the generalized Schur algorithm.
